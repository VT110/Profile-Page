    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Vincent Troyer and I'm a junior marketing major at Anderson
      University.
      <br />
      I'm 20 years old and currently working.
      <br />
      In my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, surfing, offroading, and
      snowboarding.

    <aside>An aside (get it) on my favorite animals: dogs!</aside>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They're called man's best friend for a reason. Dogs are some of the most
        loyal and protextive animals in the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dogs are also highly trainable- allowing them to be great for people
        with differing interests like hunting, fetch, tricks, and some can even
        drive (imagine that!)
